# corne-vial-markstos
A quick way to get the markstos layout on a corne keyboard with the convenience of Vial remapping.

The original markstos write-up: https://mark.stosberg.com/markstos-corne-3x5-1-keyboard-layout/

To install:
1. Set up a Vial build environment (step 1 of this https://get.vial.today/docs/porting-to-vial.html)
2. Compile the modified Vial keymap and flash to your keyboard.
3. Load the markstos layout in Vial

Features:
The modified Vial keymap is just the default for the corne but with some of the markstos quality of life features (3 presses for sticky mods, HOLD_ON_OTHER_KEY_PRESS). I ran into problems compiling when I added the original taping term settings but this should be adjustable in the qmk settings of Vial.
